# Introduction
This project was originally intended as an exercise to brush up our C++ skills, while also having fun building something. Eventually, it spinned out of control and the code size got gigantic within a short few weeks.

*Visual Novel Engine* is a versatile Visual Novel engine written in C++, and relies heavily on [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/ "SFML") for rendering and audio (the audio counterpart is actually OpenAL, which SFML is using).

# Design
*Visual Novel Engine* is designed to be easily customizable, allowing creators to add all sorts of features or animations, sound effects, etc. with relative ease. 

We basically created a whole new 'scripting language' that allows the script writer to add various commands, such as show character, set background, play music, display text, fadein/fadeout character sprites, etc. easily, and with a lot of control too! There's a lot of animation commands that accepts a Time argument as input, which allows you to time all your animated scenes perfectly.   

For a list of complete and updated commands, open Script Format Reference.xlsx (note that commands marked in Red or Yellow are not fully functional or implemented yet)

# Demo
[Youtube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfRA-XLtyR0): This is a demo video of a work-in-progress version of the program. At the end of the video there's a sample script that you can reference.

# Setup instructions after cloning
0. Install Visual Studio 2017 (Community edition should work fine) with C++ support

1. Change environment architecture from x64 to x32 on the top

2. Go to Build on the menu and click "Build Solution" (for both Debug and Release preferably)
..* If you have difficulty building the solution because it is missing some library, it is most likely because the SFML library is not linked properly. Go to https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php and follow all the steps to properly link the library

3. Copy the .dll files from SFML/SFML-2.5.1/bin folder to where your executable (.exe) file is located (usually Debug and Release folders in your project folder after you built)

4. request from [me](mailto:caiyiming2015@gmail.com) or [Ed](mailto:Kentoruya@gmail.com) for the various asset folders (images, sound, resources), or copy those folders from a working game made with our engine

5. copy all the asset folders into where your executables (.exe) files are. (usually Debug and Release folders)

5. Run the program

# TODOs
### Cosmetic and Features
* make in-game log, config, save and load states more pretty
* add 'pages' to the save/load states, so that users can have more data to choose from
* implement the various config elements in the config page, and make sure they are responsive

### Script Commands
* add screen-swap animations, other than fadein/fadeout

### System optimization
* improve run-time performance by loading all needed assets at load time 
* possibly use PhysFS, so that we can archieve all files in a password-protected zip file and load that during runtime
